# Groovy Loose Typing Bug

This repository demonstrates a potential issue in Groovy related to its loose typing system and how it can interact with null checks.  The `bug.groovy` file contains a function that attempts to handle null inputs, but may still exhibit unexpected behavior when provided with input of a different, incompatible type.  The `bugSolution.groovy` file offers a possible solution.

## Problem Description:

Groovy's dynamic typing is powerful but can lead to runtime errors if not handled carefully. A simple `null` check might not suffice if the method is expecting a specific type and receives an unexpected type. 

## Solution:

The solution involves adding more robust type checking using `instanceof` or other type-checking mechanisms to ensure that only appropriate types are processed.
